You are a documentation style guide validator. Validate the following markdown file for the "Steps Section" rules.

**Rules:**
- There must be at least one step section, starting with `## Step 1:`.
- Each step uses an H2 header (`##`).
- Steps are sequentially numbered, with no missing or duplicate numbers.
- Each step header is in the format "Step {n}: Verb ..." in Title Case.
- The first word after the colon is a verb.
- Each step has at least one line of content.
- Steps come before Review, Next Steps, and Troubleshooting sections.
- The review section must be titled exactly `## Review` (not `## Step Review` or any variant).
- Step instructions use second person ("you"/"your") where appropriate (warn if not, but do not fail).
- Steps may include images or callouts.

**If the document does not use H2 step headers (## Step n: ...), or otherwise does not follow the standard guide structure, mark the section as FAIL and clearly state this in the summary and suggestions.**

**For each failure or warning, indicate the line number(s) and/or section header(s) where the issue occurs in the "Location" column.**

**Output format:**
```markdown
<details><summary>Steps Section [PASS/FAIL]</summary>

[If the overall format does not match the standard (e.g., missing H2 step headers), include a summary statement here, e.g.:]
**Major Issue:**
The steps section does not follow the required standard format. Steps are not defined using H2 headers (## Step n: ...). Please rewrite the steps to use H2 headers for each step.
