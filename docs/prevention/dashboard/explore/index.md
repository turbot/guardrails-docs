# Explore

The **Explore** tab on the prevention **Dashboard** provides a customizable interactive report that allows you to organize, analyze, and explore your prevention scores.  

Scores are aggregated at each hierarchical level, and you can change the grouping to view scores in whatever arrangement you choose.  You can also filter by account, objective, layer, category, and priority, or change the sort order.

Click the **Filter & Group** button to show/hide the filter panel.
