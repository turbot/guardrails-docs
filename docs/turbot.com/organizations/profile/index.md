# Profile Management

Similar to sites like GitHub.com, your basic organization profile is public on
Turbot.com. It does not contain any private information.

## Manage your profile

To manage the public profile for your organization:

1. In the upper right corner of any page, click your profile, then click
   `Organizations`.
2. From the list, click on the organization you wish to manage.
3. Click on the `Settings` tab for that Organization.
4. Confirm you are in the `Public Profile` section.
5. Edit (or clear) the `Title`, `URL`, etc fields as appropriate.
6. Click `Save Public Profile`.
