# Setup an Organization

Create an organization to manage shared Workspaces, Mods, Billing and other
information. Add team members to share responsibility for management.

## Create an organization

1. In the upper right corner of any page, click your profile, then click
   `Organizations`.
2. Click `Create Organization`, and enter your details:
   1. `Name` is a unique username for the organization, e.g. `gnb`. It must be
      lowercase, and **cannot be changed**.
   2. `Title` is a flexible, short description, e.g. `Goliath National Bank`. It
      can be changed at any time.
   3. Save by clicking `Create Organization`.

_Note: Similar to sites like GitHub.com, your basic organization profile is
public on Turbot.com._
