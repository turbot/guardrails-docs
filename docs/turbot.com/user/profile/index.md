# Profile Management

Similar to sites like GitHub.com, your basic organization profile is public on
Turbot.com. It does not contain any private information.

## Manage your profile

To manage your public profile:

1. In the upper right corner of any page, click your profile, then click
   `Settings`.
2. Confirm you are in the `Public Profile` section.
3. Edit (or clear) the `Title`, `URL`, etc fields as appropriate.
4. Click `Save Public Profile`.
