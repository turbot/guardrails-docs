# API Access Keys in Guardrails

In order to interact with the Guardrails GraphQL API, users must first generate an API access key pair. Any user with access to the Guardrails UI can generate an access key. However, permissions within Guardrails can and will limit the actions permitted via the API.

## Generate a new Guardrails API Access Key

1. Log into Guardrails.

4. Copy the private key into a secure location, as this will be the first and last time it will be available. The key pair can be used to access the Guardrails API immediately.

## Deactivate a Guardrails API Access Key

1. Log into Guardrails.
2. Click on your user name (or avatar, if you have one) in the top right. It will take you to the **User Profile Overview** page.
3. Click on the **Access Keys** tab, then the green button titled **Create Access Key**.

**Note**: Access keys that are deactivated will not be able to authenticate to the Guardrails API. They can, however, be reactivated by clicking the gray up arrow.
