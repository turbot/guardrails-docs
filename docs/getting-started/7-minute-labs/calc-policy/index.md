# Calculated Policies in 7 minutes

| Goal | Use calculated policies to dynamically determine policy values |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Overview

While most policy settings can be set with a simple static value, there may be
instances where you need more flexibility in determining the correct option.
[Calculated policies](guides/managing-policies#using-calculated-polices) allow
you to dynamically compute policy values using any information in the Turbot Guardrails
CMDB.

<div className="alert alert-info">
Any policy in Turbot Guardrails can use a calculated policy instead of a static value!
</div>

In this exercise, you will create a calculated policy to set the
`AWS > S3 > Bucket > Tags > Template` using the Turbot Guardrails Console.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create and test calculated policies
in the Turbot Guardrails Console.

## Prerequisites

- [Install the aws and aws-s3 mods](mods/install). This lab exercise uses
  policies in the `aws-s3` mod, so it must be installed in your Workspace.

- You should be familiar with the basics of
  [Managing Policies](guides/managing-policies). You may want to start with the
  [Policy Settings in 7 minutes](7-minute-labs/set-policy) lab.

- You must have at least one S3 bucket that has been discovered in your
  workspace. It is recommended that you create a test bucket for this lab (or
  re-use the bucket you created for
  [Policy Settings in 7 minutes](7-minute-labs/set-policy))

## Create/Edit the Policy Setting

1. Log into the Turbot Guardrails Console as an Administrator (`Turbot/Admin` or `Turbot/Owner`), then click the **Policies** tab.
2. Click the green **New Policy Setting** button.
3. Search and select `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Tags > Template` as **Policy Type**.
4. In the **Resource** field, select the test bucket created in the
   [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) setup. You can search for it by name, or
   **Browse** and select it.
5. In the **Setting** section, click the link `Enable calculated mode`. Then
   **Launch calculated policy builder**. This will allow you to create and test
   your calculated policy.
6. By default, the test bucket that you set in the **Resource** should be set as
   the **Test Resource**.

### Define the GraphQL input query

To get information from the CMDB to use in our policy, you need to specify a
[GraphQL](reference/graphql) Query. Copy & paste this query into the **Step 2:
Query data using GraphQL** field:

```graphql
{
  bucket {
    Name
    tags
  }
}
```

Note that the box to the right is populated with the results of your query
against the **Test Resource**. For example:

```json
{
  "bucket": {
    "Name": "turbot-bucket-version",
    "tags": {
      "Company": "Vandelay Industries",
      "Department": "Sales",
      "Cost Center": "314159"
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a template to format the results

The `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Tags > Template` expects the tags to be formatted yaml
object as a set of `key: value` pairs. You can use a
[nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template to transform the query
results into the format expected by the Policy Type.

Copy & paste this template into the **Step 3: Transform using Jinja2 Template**
field. For example:

```yaml
Company: "Vandelay Industries"
Department:
  "{% if $.bucket.tags['Department'] in ['Sales', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'HR'] %}{{
  $.bucket.tags['Department'] }}{% else %}Non-Compliant Tag{% endif %}"
Cost Center:
  "{% if $.bucket.tags['Cost Center'] %}{{ $.bucket.tags['Cost Center'] }}{%
  else %}Non-Compliant Tag{% endif %}"
Environment:
  "{% if $.bucket.tags['Environment'] in ['Dev', 'QA', 'Prod', 'Temp'] %}{{
  $.bucket.tags['Environment'] }}{% else %}Non-Compliant Tag{% endif %}"
```

The template uses standard [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/),
allowing you to use conditional logic, iterate over items, and perform complex
transformations of the data.

Notice that the results of rendering your template with the data from the input
query are shown to the right of the template. The box at the bottom shows the
final, rendered policy value after validation against the schema for the policy
type. ![](/images/docs/guardrails/calculated-policy-test.png)

Click **Create** to create this setting (or **Update** if you are updating an
existing setting).

The policy value for this bucket will not be calculated. Any changes to the data
in the input query will cause this policy to be re-calculated bases on the new
values.

Note that you created this setting on the bucket itself, thus only this bucket
will be affected. If you made the setting at a higher level in the hierarchy, it
would apply to every bucket below. For example, setting this calculated policy
at the AWS Account level would cause every S3 bucket in the account to calculate
_its own_ value, based on _its own_ data in the CMDB.

## Expand your query

1. Search and select `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Tags > Template` policy setting, and
   click **EDIT** to update it.

2. Update the Graphql. Make the following changes to the query. _For this
   exercise, you should type these changes -- do not cut and paste_.

```graphql
{
  // highlight-start
  region {
    Name
  }
  // highlight-end
  bucket {
    Name
    tags
  }
}
```

<!-- Currently the below feature is not available so commented out. 10-02-2021 -->
<!-- Notice that as you type, the editor suggests keywords and properties.  Use the auto-complete to try adding other fields to the query. -->

![](/images/docs/guardrails/update-cal-policy.png)

The GraphQL available in calculated policies is a super-set of the
[Turbot Guardrails GraphQL API](reference/graphql). The API is extended with dynamic
queries for the Turbot Guardrails Resource Type that automatically pivot based on the
context of the current resource. Notice in the example query that we added
`region` to the query - Guardrails assumes that we mean the `region` resource in
which _this bucket resides_. Likewise, you may use `account` and `folder` to get
information about account and folder above the bucket in the hierarchy.

You can discover the schema for these resources via auto-complete, or by viewing
the schema definition in the **Inspect** tab of the [mod documentation](https://hub.guardrails.turbot.com/#mods).
The `bucket` query refers to the
[S3 Bucket Schema](mods/turbot/aws-s3/inspect#/definitions/bucket), as an
example.

You can also view the schema by looking at the **Explore** page on an existing
resource. Occasionally, attributes may exist in the CMDB that are not explicitly
defined in the schema definition. You can use `get` to retrieve these items.

1. Go to the **Explore** page for your test bucket resource. Notice that there
   is a `Grantee` attribute for this resource.
2. View the
   [S3 Bucket Schema definition](mods/turbot/aws-s3/inspect#/definitions/bucket).
   Notice that `Grantee` is not explicitly defined as an attribute.
3. To query the `Grantee` attribute, you must use a `get` query. Edit your query
   as follows:

```graphql
{
  region {
    Name
  }
  bucket {
    Name
    tags
    grantee: get(path: "Acl.Grants[0].Grantee")  //highlight-line
  }
}
```

4. Notice that the `grantee` is now added to your query results.

The combination of GraphQL and Nunjucks make calculated policies powerful and
flexible. Any Turbot Guardrails policy can be calculated, using any data in the entire
CMDB!

## Improved Multi‚ÄêQuery Calc Process

Calculated policies offer powerful flexibility by dynamically generating policy values based on real-time data from the Turbot Guardrails CMDB. While static values may suffice for many policy settings, calculated policies enable more responsive and adaptive configurations, using contextual resource information. Recent enhancements have streamlined this approach by embedding the initial query directly into the context. This eliminates the need for repetitive queries, reducing redundancy and improving overall performance, allowing for faster and more efficient policy management.

### Previous Approach: Two-Query Process

1.	First, you needed to retrieve the Resource ID. To do this, you would run a separate query like the following:

```graphql
{
  resource {
    turbot {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
This query was essential to fetch the resource ID before accessing further data.

2.	After retrieving the Resource ID, you could then use it in another query to fetch the budget-related data, such as actual spend, forecasted spend, and last updated time. For example:

```graphql
{
  budgetData: resources(filter: "resourceTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/aws#/resource/types/budget' resourceId:{{ $.resource.turbot.id }}") {
    items {
      currentMonthActualSpend: get(path:"currentMonthActualSpend")
      currentMonthForecastSpend: get(path:"currentMonthForecastSpend")
      lastUpdatedTime: get(path:"lastUpdatedTime")
      metadata
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that the second query relied on the output of the first query (i.e., the resource ID) to retrieve the relevant budget data.

### Simplified Query Process

1. The first query that fetched the resource ID is now automatically handled by the system and is always available in the context.
2. You no longer need to write the first query explicitly; the context will automatically contain the resource ID, simplifying your work.

With the resource ID now provided by default, you can focus directly on writing the second query without worrying about fetching the resource ID first.

Example Query:

```graphql
{
  budgetData: resources(filter: "resourceTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/aws#/resource/types/budget' resourceId:{{ $.resource.turbot.id }}") {
    items {
      currentMonthActualSpend: get(path:"currentMonthActualSpend")
      currentMonthForecastSpend: get(path:"currentMonthForecastSpend")
      lastUpdatedTime: get(path:"lastUpdatedTime")
      metadata
    }
  }
}
```

### Benefits:

* **Reduces Redundancy**: There‚Äôs no longer a need to run a separate query to fetch the resource ID every time.
* **Simplifies Code**: With fewer queries, your code is cleaner and easier to maintain.
* **Faster Process**: Queries are executed more efficiently since unnecessary requests are avoided.

### Default Fields in Context

By default, the context now includes the following fields for each resource, so you don‚Äôt need to explicitly query them:

```graphql 
{
  resource {
    parent {
      turbot {
        id
      }
      type {
        uri
      }
    }
    turbot {
      id
      tags
    }
    type {
      uri
    }
  }
}
```

These fields are automatically available in the context, making the query process more efficient and streamlined.
