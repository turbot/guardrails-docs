# Guardrails Governance

Cloud governance is the discipline of designing and implementing systematic frameworks that enable organizations to use cloud resources effectively while managing risk, controlling costs, and maintaining compliance. Unlike traditional IT governance, which relies on manual processes and approval gates, cloud governance provides automated guardrails that allow teams to move fast while staying within safe boundaries.

At its core, cloud governance addresses a fundamental challenge: how do you maintain control and oversight in an environment where infrastructure changes constantly, resources are provisioned on-demand, and application teams have direct control over the services their applications depend on?

Turbot Guardrails provides a complete cloud governance platform:

1. **Know Your Cloud**: The Guardrails CMDB provides a flexible, dynamic [asset inventory](using/governance/inventory).
1. **Raise the Bar**:  [Guardrails](using/governance/guardrails) enable you to define and implement your standards and automatically remediate your control objectives.
1. **Make Change Happen**: Driving organizational adoption requires working with *people*.  [Rollouts](using/governance/rollouts) provide a predictable, ordered mechanism for deploying guardrails to your organization, enabling you to define a rollout and communications plan for your guardrails.
