If you are already a customer, please reach out to your local Guardrails Admin for access to your current environment.

## Free Trial Information

Guardrails offers a free trial to interested organizations. Here's how to kickstart your experience:

1. [Sign up for your Turbot.com account](turbot.com/user/sign-up): This grants access to your Free Trial Guardrails Workspace. We only need one team member to sign up initially - more can join later.
2. [Chat with Bob about your Free Trial onboarding](/start)

After your chat with Bob, we'll get your free trial up and running and send you the login instructions. The trial encompasses an onboarding call, check-ins, and a closing or upgrade meeting.

Questions? Don't hesitate to reach out to your Turbot representative or email [Turbot Sales](mailto:sales+poc@turbot.com).

## First Steps

Once you have received your login URL from Turbot, follow the steps below to log
into your Turbot Workspace.

### Login

1. Go to your dedicated Turbot Workspace URL. This will either be given to you
   by Turbot or defined by the organization. Reach out to your Turbot contact if
   there are questions.
2. Select the **Turbot SAML** directory option in the dropdown menu. This will
   only appear for new Turbot Guardrails Cloud users. This directory name
   might be different for existing customers who setup their own identity provider.

3. Select **Login with Turbot**. This will re-direct you to the sign in page.
   More info can be found on our
   [Turbot User Sign Up docs](turbot.com/user/sign-up).

### Optional: Add team members to your Turbot Workspace

If you are using the Turbot SAML authentication method, first have your team
member create a free account on our
[User Sign Up Page](turbot.com/user/sign-up).

1. Ask your team member to login to the Workspace using Turbot SAML with the newly created account.
2. Immediately upon logging in, a new user profile is created. As `Turbot/Owner` of the workspace, you can now assign
   permissions to your team member.
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab designated by user icon.
4. Click the green **Grant Permissions** button.
5. Leave the resource scope as `Turbot`.
6. In the **Identities** field, type in the user name of your team member. Select the profile in the
   drop down menu.
7. Click the **Permissions** field and select `Turbot/Owner`.
8. Click the **Grant** button.
9. Your team member will now have the same level of permissions as yourself.
   These can be modified in the future to be more specific.

### Now what?

Congrats! Now that you have signed in (and optionally added a team member to the
workspace), we need to import a cloud account for Turbot to manage. Click the
following link to get going! Additionally, you can use the nav bar on the left
to jump to a specific subsection.
