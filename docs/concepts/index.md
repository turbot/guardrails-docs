# Guardrails Concepts

Turbot Guardrails provides enterprise guardrails for infrastructure platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

Balancing agility with controls requires a clear and simple set of beliefs guiding our designs and trade-off decisions. This section outlines how Guardrails thinks about enterprise controls for infrastructure governance and outlines the beliefs, models and assumptions Turbot Guardrails has defined to create those guardrails - providing organizations with a working balance between agility and compliance.
