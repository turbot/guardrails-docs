Using playwright, I'd like you to navigate to https://punisher-turbot.cloud.turbot-dev.com/apollo/login. I can login for you when I am prompted.

Notes: Some pages can be slow to load - especially the dashboards. Always wait rather than giving up or guessing new URLs.

You should record the rest of the process as an SOP document with screenshots. The file should be stored in index.md /Users/raj/raj-professional-tasks/turbot/guardrails/guardrails-docs/docs/guides/using-guardrails/console/reports/playwright

For the style guide draw inspiration from https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/console/reports/find-policies-in-tbd-state

Once logged in navigate to Reports section and search for Controls section. Take a report for Controls by Controls Type and check for all controls in Error state.

The browser width should be 1280px.
For screenshots, I'd like you to:
1. Always take them as full browser width.
2. You can vary the height appropriately to show key information.
