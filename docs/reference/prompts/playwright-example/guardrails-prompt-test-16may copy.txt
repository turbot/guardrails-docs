Using playwright, I'd like you to navigate to https://punisher-turbot.cloud.turbot-dev.com/apollo/login. I can login for you when I am prompted.

Some pages can be slow to load - especially the dashboards. Always wait rather than giving up or guessing new URLs.

Use case
Enable Encryption in Transit for specific S3 bucket using Turbot Guardrails. Refer https://hub.guardrails.turbot.com/mods/aws/policies/aws-s3/encryptionInTransit

Guide location:
- The file should be stored in index.md docs/guides/using-guardrails/encryption/s3
- Refer existing structure as example i.e. docs/guides/using-guardrails/console/reports/find-policies-in-tbd-state/index.md

You should record the rest of the process as an SOP document with screenshots.

Screenshots:
1. Always take them as full browser width.
2. You can vary the height appropriately to show key information.
3. Images should be in the same base folder of the index.md

NOTE: If screenshots are not aligned to the requirement or difficulties to take, ask me to take a screenshot and provide in the targeted folder during the process. Wait for my confirmation.

Style guide:
- refer docs/guides/using-guardrails/console/reports/find-policies-in-tbd-state/index.md
- Guide Structure inline with docs/guides/using-guardrails/console/reports/find-policies-in-tbd-state/index.md
  - YAML frontmatter (title, sidebar_label, guide_type)
  - H1 title matching frontmatter
  - Overview (no heading) explaining what, why, and how
  - Prerequisites section with necessary items
  - Step sections (5 words or less, starting with verbs)
  - Include Review step
  - Add Next Steps section
  - Add Troubleshooting table refer ## Troubleshooting section of find-policies-in-tbd-state/index.md
  - Second-person voice ("you")
  - Bold UI elements: Button Name and Tab Names
  - Code and input in backticks: example-input
  - GitHub-style call-outs: > [!NOTE], > [!TIP], etc.

Adding to sidebar
Add to navigation bar to make your guide visible in the documentation navigation, you need to add it to the sidebar configuration using docs/sidebar.json structure.
