1. Based on this lets proceed to generate the guide
2. Using playwright can you take screenshots? I can help in login if required in new browser
3. Yes start the process
4. Proceed next
5. bucket name is  testraj2025
6. Go to resources and search for  testraj2025
7. Proceed next step
8. Not appearing, navigate to RESOURCES and search for the bucket name
9. I had to click, now its visible. Proceed
10. Yes
11. Yes set to Enforced as exception this this bucket
12. Yes
13. Lets proceed to complete the guide and add to sidebar
14. Which location these images are stored?


15. Move these images from the current location to docs/guides/using-guardrails/encryption/s3 as mentioned and make appropirate changed in the index.md

--- appropirate changed in the index.md dees not make sense, rather be more specific instruction to provide a example format for the image link.


16. Now follow the image pattern as mention in @index.md

---- Change the prompt here
The markdown image link does not match to the recommended style guide, I want you to do ??? new markdown links and provide examples

![Policy Values by State](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/using-guardrails/console/reports/find-policies-in-tbd-state/guardrails-policy-values-by-state.png)


17. I get this below error while deploying primarily indicating the missing structure

To solve this we need to add index.md in docs/guides/using-guardrails/encryption and provide link to the generated new file - see example  docs/guides/using-guardrails/iam/index.md structure
