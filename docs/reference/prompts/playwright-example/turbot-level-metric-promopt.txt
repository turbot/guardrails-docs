Using playwright, I'd like you to navigate to https://punisher-turbot.cloud.turbot-dev.com/apollo/login and process through the below information to create a new guide.

When you login, ask me to confirm to login as applicable.

Location of guide should be docs/guides/using-guardrails/console/reports/<provide-meaningful-name>

The use-case is, after you've logged in, I want you to navigate through to a Turbot folder, find Metrics and run over few screens to explain in highlevel. Don't drill into it.

Take screenshots and save locally where the index.md file is saved as mentioned above.

Ask me to add more context if required

The content should be arranged in the STYLE of docs/guides/hosting-guardrails/updating-stacks/update-ted/index.md

Add to navigation bar to make your guide visible in the documentation navigation, you need to add it to the sidebar configuration using docs/sidebar.json structure.

Consider to add value add conent related to the actions in Turbot's Guardrails
