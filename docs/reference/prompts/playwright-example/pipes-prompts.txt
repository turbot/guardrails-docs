Using playwright, I'd like you to navigate to https://pipes.turbot.com. You should then login - ask me if you need credentials or me to do something. The login name is raj@turbot.com.

Choose turbot-ops organization After you've logged in, I want you to navigate through to a workspace choose rajtest workspace find powerpipe, and run the AWS PCI DSS v4.0 benchmark.

Don't drill into it, once you have a screenshot of the dashboard the process is complete. After you've logged in, you should record the rest of the process as an SOP document with screenshots.

Notes: *Some pages can be slow to load - especially the dashboards. Always wait rather than giving up or guessing new URLs. *

The browser width should be 1280px.
For screenshots, I'd like you to:
1. Always take them as full browser width.
2. You can vary the height appropriately to show key information.

The style guide for SOP in markdown should follow as below
