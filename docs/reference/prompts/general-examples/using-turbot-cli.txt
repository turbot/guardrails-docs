Create a new guide based on below CLI command by using Guardrails MCP in punisher workspace i.e. https://punisher-turbot.cloud.turbot-dev.com/

turbot graphql \
  --query 'mutation AttachPolicyPack {
    attachPolicyPacks(
      input: {
        resource: "111111111111111",
        policyPacks: "222222222222222"
      }
    ) {
      turbot {
        id
      }
    }
  }'

Replace 111111111111111 with the Turbot ID of the resource you want to attach the Policy Pack to.
Replace 222222222222222 with the ID of the Policy Pack you wish to attach.

   - Prerequisites section with necessary items
   - Step sections (5 words or less, starting with verbs)
   - Monitor or Review steps

   - Troubleshooting table

2. Style:
   - Bold UI elements: **Button Name** and **Tab Names**
   - Code and input in backticks: `example-input`
   - GitHub-style call-outs: > [!NOTE], > [!TIP], etc. as applicable based on additional information you would like to add.

3. Add to navigation bar to make your guide visible in the documentation navigation, you need to add it to the sidebar configuration using docs/sidebar.json structure.
