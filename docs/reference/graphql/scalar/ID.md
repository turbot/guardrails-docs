# ID

<div style={{'fontFamily':'monospace'}}><span style={{'fontSize':'1.5rem','fontWeight':500}}>ID</span></div>

The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.
