# Mutations

Every GraphQL schema has a root type for both queries and mutations. The [mutation type](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Type-System) defines GraphQL operations that change data on the server. It is analogous to performing HTTP verbs such as `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.
