# Disconnect an AWS account from a Guardrails workspace

In this guide, you will:
- Decommission Guardrails-managed resources in an AWS account.
- Disconnect the AWS account from the Guardrails workspace using the Guardrails console.

As part of regular Guardrails workspace maintenance, it is sometimes necessary to remove AWS accounts. This process involves two key steps: first, [Decommission Guardrails-managed resources](#decommission-guardrails-infrastructure) in the AWS account by updating relevant policy settingsâ€”administrators should assess whether to retain resources like S3 buckets or CloudTrail, though Event Handlers must always be removed; second, [Disconnect the AWS account from Guardrails](#disconnect-aws-account-from-guardrails) workspace, which is a change made only on the Guardrails side and does not affect the AWS account itself.

> [!NOTE] Disconnecting an AWS account from Guardrails will remove all child CMDB records and policy settings.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Guardrails console with **Administrator** privileges.
- Familiarity with the Guardrails Policies.

## Decommission Guardrails-managed resources

To fully clean up Guardrails-managed resources in the AWS account, specific policy settings must be applied with the recommended values. If you intend to retain any of these resources, simply skip applying the corresponding policy. Once configured, allow time for Guardrails to complete the removal process. These policy settings are safe to apply even if there is no existing `Enforce: Enabled` configuration in place.

## Step 1: Navigate to Policies

Log into the Guardrails console with provided local credentials or by using any SAML-based login and select **Policies** from the top navigation menu.

## Step 2: Remove Guardrails-Managed IAM Resources

Set the `AWS > Turbot > Permissions` policy to `Enforce: None`. This will remove Guardrails-managed IAM policies, groups, roles and users.

![Guardrails Permissions](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-turbot-permissions.png)

## Step 3: Remove CloudTrail

Set the `AWS > Turbot > Audit Trail` policy to `Enforce: Not configured`. This will remove the Guardrails-managed CloudTrail.

![Guardrails CloudTrail](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-remove-cloudtrail.png)

## Step 4: Remove Regional Event Handlers

Set the `AWS > Turbot > Event Handlers` policy to `Enforce: Not configured`. This will remove Guardrails-managed Cloudwatch Event Rules and SNS topics. Refer to the [Event Handler documentation](integrations/aws/event-handlers) for additional context.

![Guardrails Regional Event Handlers](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-regional-event-handlers.png)

## Step 5: Remove Global Event Handlers

Set the `AWS > Turbot > Event Handlers [Global]` policy to `Enforce: Not configured`. This will remove Guardrails-managed Cloudwatch Event Rules and SNS topics.

![Guardrails Global Event Handlers](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-global-event-handlers.png)

## Step 6: Remove IAM Service Roles

Set the `AWS > Turbot > Service Roles` policy to `Enforce: Not configured`. This will remove any Guardrails-managed IAM service roles.

![Guardrails IAM Service Roles](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-service-roles.png)

## Step 7: Remove Logging Buckets

Set the `AWS > Turbot > Logging > Bucket` policy to `Enforce: Not configured`. This will remove Guardrails-managed logging S3 buckets. 
   
> [!NOTE] Logging buckets cannot be deleted if they are not empty. Administrators can empty the bucket using the AWS console.

![Guardrails Logging buckets](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-logging-bucket.png)

## Step 8: Disable Event Poller

Set the `AWS > Turbot > Event Poller` policy to `Disabled`.

![Guardrails Event Poller](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-event-poller.png)

> [!IMPORTANT] When event handlers are set to `Skip` or `Enforce: Not Configured`, Polling is automatically enabled. It must be explicitly disabled. Note that full cleanup of event handler resources requires event pollers to still be active. Disable Event Pollers _after_ verifying that all Event Handler infrastructure has been removed from the account.

Once the controls associated with the above policies have completed, the AWS account can be disconnected from the Guardrails workspace.

## Disconnect AWS Account from Guardrails

When a user with sufficient permissions attempts to disconnect an AWS account, Guardrails will try to remove the
account, all child resources, controls, policy settings in a single SQL transactions. This is done for safety. Should
the transaction fail, it's trivial for the database to roll back to a known good state. The effect of this rollback is
that the account remains visible in Guardrails. AWS accounts with larger numbers of resources, the time required to
complete the transaction may exceed the statement timeout limit. 

## Step 1: Delete Turbot IAM Role Policies

Before disconnecting the account, delete the policies listed below from the target account. Once removed, you can proceed to delete the account from Guardrails.

`AWS > Account > Turbot IAM Role > External ID`

![External ID](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-turbot-external-id.png)

`AWS > Account > Turbot IAM Role`

![Turbot IAM Role](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-turbot-iam-role.png)

## Step 2: Navigate to Account

In the Guardrails console, navigate to the account that needs to be removed.

![Select Account](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-select-account.png)

## Step 3: Delete Account

Select **Remove from Turbot** from the **Action** drop down in the top right. If you do not see it, reach out to your Guardrails workspace administrator for proper access.

![Remove from Turbot](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-delete-account.png)

Copy the account ID and paste in the text box and select **Delete**.

![Confirm Delete](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-confirm-delete.png)

> [!WARNING] While this is not irreversible (simply reimport the account), it can be time and resource consuming. Be sure to double and triple check!

Guardrails will begin the delete process. The time to complete the deletion will depend on the number of resources and policies that will be removed. The more resources that are being deleted, the longer the process will take.

> [!IMPORTANT]The disconnection step may time out due to a number of factors including but not limited to overall system load, and the number of resources in the account. The general aim is to reduce the number of resources in the account.

## Resource Count Reduction

### Manual

## Step 1: Navigate to Account

Navigate to the AWS Account to be disconnected and select the **Metrics** tab.

![Navigate to Account](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-locate-account.png)

## Step 2: Locate Top Resource Types

Look at the `Top Resource Types` on the left side. These are the resources to target first.

![Top Resource Types](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-top-resource-types.png)

## Step 3: Locate Policies

Switch to the **Policies** tab. Click the **New Policy Setting** button.

![Select policies](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-select-policies.png)

## Step 4: Create Resource CMDB Policy

Find the CMDB policy in the format `AWS > {Service} > {Resource Type} > CMDB`, set it to **Enforce: Disabled**, and choose **Create**. This instructs Guardrails to purge all resource records for this resource type.

![Create Resource CMDB policy](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/guardrails-locate-resource-cmdb-policy.png)

Over the next few minutes Guardrails will purge those resource CMDB entries and the overall resource count in the account will reduce.

> [!Note] If this Attempt to disconnect the account times out, continue steps 3 through 8 until the account is successfully
   disconnected.

### Automated

## Step 1: Clone Guardrails Samples Github Repo

Go to [guardrails-samples](https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples/tree/main/guardrails_utilities/python_utils/remove_aws_account) and clone the repository.

![Clone Repository](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/aws/decommission/github-guardrails-samples-repo.png)

## Step 2: Navigate to Remove AWS Account Directory

In the cloned repository, navigate to the following folder:

`guardrails_utilities/python_utils/remove_aws_account`

## Step 3: Run AWS Remove Account Script

Refer to the [README](https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples/blob/main/guardrails_utilities/python_utils/remove_aws_account/README.md) for further instructions on how to set up and run the `remove_aws_account` script.
