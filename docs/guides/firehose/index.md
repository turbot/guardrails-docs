# Guardrails Firehose for AWS SNS

The Guardrails Firehose generates an event stream of notification sent to an AWS SNS
topic. It is ideal for extracting event streams from Guardrails then sending them to
various consumers such as email, a Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM) tool, a logging tool, etc. The Firehose answers the question "Can I get a
stream of change events flowing through Guardrails?". It can't answer "How many
controls are in `ok`?" or "How many storage buckets are in the environment?"
Customers who need snapshots of the environment or bulk data extracts of
resources, control states or other data should use GraphQL or
[Steampipe](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/turbot).

Event correlation would be handled by products that consume the Firehose event
stream. Also, the Firehose is responsible for delivery of notifications to the
Firehose SNS topic. Any integrations that subscribe to the Firehose topic are
completely up to the customer. Only notifications created after Firehose
configuration will be reprocessed. There is no way to force resending of
notifications in a given time range.

## How It Works

The Guardrails Firehose composes a number of stages for taking a notification event
in Guardrails through to final delivery on an AWS SNS topic.

```
Notification generated by change on a resource, control, policy, etc -> Watch Filter selects notifications to send -> Render the Notification Template -> Publish to AWS SNS topic -> Downstream integrations
```

1. As resources, controls and policy settings change inside Guardrails, entries are
   added to the Notifications table.
2. Watch filters select some subset of those notifications to be send to the
   Firehose.
3. Notifications are passed through a Notification Template to prepare them for
   delivery to the Firehose.
4. A background process takes rendered notifications then publishes them to the
   Firehose Topic.

## Setup Guardrails Workspace and AWS Resources

The following steps cover how to manually install and configure the mod. If
Terraform is preferred, use this
[mod example](https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-tools/tree/master/mod_examples/firehose-aws-sns/setup/terraform)
for steps 2 - 5 and creating the Guardrails Firehose.

1. Install the mod into the workspace if not already installed. See
   [Installing Mods](mods/guide/install) for more
   guidance.
2. Create the AWS SNS topic. It can be in any account and any region. All the
   notifications will be forwarded to this topic.
3. Create an AWS IAM User with access to the above SNS topic. Guardrails will use
   this user to publish to the SNS topic. Guardrails recommends having a specific
   user that is only used for notification forwarding. The IAM policy on the
   Firehose user should also be least-privilege with only `Publish` permissions
   to the Firehose SNS topic alone.
4. Generate an access key pair for the above IAM User.
5. Set the following Guardrails policies. Note that these can ONLY be set at the
   Turbot level:
   - `Turbot > Firehose > AWS SNS > Notification Topic` - This is the topic ARN
     from step 2.
   - `Turbot > Firehose > AWS SNS > Notification Access Key` - This is the
     access key from step 4.
   - `Turbot > Firehose > AWS SNS > Notification Secret Key` - This is the
     secret key from step 4.
6. This completes the AWS configuration and Guardrails Workspace configuration.
   Watches must still be created for notifications to flow through the Firehose.

## Setup Firehose Watches

A Guardrails Firehose watch specifies a set of parameters used to filter for which
notifications to send. A watch consists of the following:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                   | Common Value                                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| action    | [REQUIRED] The action the Watch takes when it finds a match, either a Guardrails ID or URI.                                   | tmod:@turbot/firehose-aws-sns#/action/types/router                              |
| favorite  | [OPTIONAL] Favorite to associate the Watch with, as a Guardrails ID.                                                          | Varies by user                                                                  |
| filter    | [REQUIRED] A valid [filter](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/reference/filter) to determine which notifications to process.         | Varies by use case                                                              |
| resource  | [REQUIRED] The resource to create the Watch for, either a Guardrails ID or AKA.                                               | Turbot resource ("tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"), Guardrails Folder, or Cloud resource |

The
[Terraform docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/turbot/turbot/latest/docs/resources/watch)
show how to set this information using Terraform. Generally, the `filter`
parameter is the most complex and has extensive coverage below.

### Watch Filters

Watches specify the filter criteria for matching notifications. A matched
notification will be sent through the Firehose pipeline. More information on
notification filters can be found in the
[Notification Filters](reference/filter/notifications) docs.

### Warnings and Notes on Watches

**WARNING**

- Creating other notifications beyond the supported notification types below
  will cause system instability.

**NOTE**

- Watches do not support specifying a `resourceId` in the filter. If you want to
  monitor a specific resource, create the watch on that resource instead.
- Filtering by `control_updated` notifications by control state is not
  supported. All control state notifications will be delivered if
  `notificationType:'control_updated'` is specified.

### Creating Filters for Watches Easily

Manually constructing Watch filter strings can be tedious and error-prone.
Instead, Watch filters can be interactively prototyped using the "Activity
Ledger" report in the Guardrails Console. Guardrails will also auto-generate the filter
string.

1. Go to the Reports tab in the Guardrails Console.
2. Find the "Activity Ledger" report. Both the Firehose and Activity Ledger
   report examine the `notifications` table, so whatever rows show up in the
   Activity Ledger will show up in the Firehose too.
3. Customize the report to provide exactly the desired information.
   ![Activity Ledger Custom Report](/images/docs/guardrails/activity_ledger_custom_report.png)
4. Go to the little Developers tab on the reports page. Click on one of the
   queries in the GraphQL section. This will take you to the main GraphiQL
   console.
   ![Little Developers Tab](/images/docs/guardrails/activity_ledger_notifications.png)
5. In the bottom left, there’s a Query Variables section.
6. The “filter” in the variable section is the machine generated filter that
   matches your report.
   ![Get the filter from the variables section](/images/docs/guardrails/activity_ledger_filter.png)
7. Copy the filter string into your watch.
8. Create the watch using the GraphQL queries in the next section.

This same process is used when building filter strings for Steampipe queries for
the
[turbot_notification](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/turbot/tables/turbot_notification)
table.

When building a watch filter string using the Activity Report, Guardrails may
include the umbrella notification types `resource` and `control`. The `resource`
notification type aggregates `resource_created`, `resource_updated` and
`resource_deleted`. The `control` notification type aggregates the
`control_notify` and `control_updated` notification types. The umbrella
notification types are a good starting place but can be replaced if more
specificity is required.

There is an important difference between `control_notify` and `control_updated`.
Control Notify will tell you when a control has taken an action, typically to
remediate. Control Updated notifications record when a control has changed
state. Customers are typically more interested in the `control_updated`
notifications.

### Common Filters

While the Firehose has a wide selection of
[notification types](#supported-notification-types), the most commonly used are
`control_updated`, `resource_created`, `resource_updated` and
`resource_deleted`. The below examples should serve as a starting point. Filters
for specific cloud accounts or services can be built using the
[creating filters](#creating-filters-for-watches) instructions above.

#### Controls

- All AWS Control Updates for entire workspace:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/aws#/resource/types/aws'`
- All Azure Control Updates for entire workspace:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/azure#/resource/types/azure'`
- All GCP Control Updates for entire workspace:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/gcp#/resource/types/gcp'`
- All cloud platforms for entire workspace:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/aws#/resource/types/aws','tmod:@turbot/azure#/resource/types/azure','tmod:@turbot/gcp#/resource/types/gcp'`

- All AWS S3 Bucket Control Updates for entire workspace:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/aws-s3#/resource/types/bucket'`
- All Azure Storage Account Control Updates for entire workspace:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/azure-storage#/resource/types/storageAccount'`
- All GCP Bucket Control Updates for entire workspace:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/gcp-storage#/resource/types/bucket'`

- Encryption at Rest controls for all Cloud Platforms:
  `notificationType:control_updated controlCategoryId:'tmod:@turbot/turbot#/control/categories/resourceEncryptionAtRest'`

#### Resources

- Resource Created: `notificationType:resource_created`
- Resource Updated: `notificationType:resource_updated`
- Resource Deleted: `notificationType:resource_deleted`
- All Resource Changes: `notificationType:resource` or
  `notificationType:resource_create,resource_updated,resource_deleted`

### Creating Watches

Firehose watches can be created and managed using GraphQL or Terraform.

#### Create Watch by Terraform

Watches can be created by Terraform. The
[Terraform docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/turbot/turbot/latest/docs/resources/watch)
have more information.

```terraform
resource "turbot_watch" "active_grants_deleted" {
  resource = "185423120545381"
  action   = "tmod:@turbot/firehose-aws-sns#/action/types/router"
  filters  = [
    "level:self,descendant notificationType:active_grants_deleted"
  ]
}
```

Updating and deleting Watches using Terraform is done in the usual way. If a
watch does not update with Terraform then destroy the watch and recreate it with
the new filter string.

#### Create Watch by GraphQL

Create a watch using GraphQL:

```graphql
mutation CreateWatch($input: CreateWatchInput!) {
  createWatch(input: $input) {
    filters
    handler
    turbot {
      id
      resourceId
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL Input: Note that the `resource` field should be one of these: The Guardrails
resource, a Guardrails folder or a cloud resource. Attaching a watch to any other
type of resource (Guardrails control types, policy settings, etc) won't generate the
expected notifications.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "resource": "185423120545381",
    "action": "tmod:@turbot/firehose-aws-sns#/action/types/router",
    "filters": ["level:self,descendant notificationType:active_grants_deleted"]
  }
}
```

Upon successful watch creation, you will see a response like the below example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createWatch": {
      "filters": [
        "resourceId:185423120545381 level:self,descendant notificationType:active_grants_deleted"
      ],
      "handler": {
        "action": "tmod:@turbot/firehose-aws-sns#/action/types/router"
      },
      "turbot": {
        "id": "215276026059506",
        "resourceId": "185423120545381"
      }
    }
  }
}

To get the list, use the following example.

```graphql
query MyWatches {
  watches(filter: "") {
    items {
      handler
      filters
      watchRules {
        metadata {
          filters
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Guardrails will return any watches:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "watches": {
      "items": [
        {
          "handler": {
            "action": "tmod:@turbot/firehose-aws-sns#/action/types/router"
          },
          "filters": [
            "resourceId:185423120545381 level:self,descendant notificationType:active_grants_deleted"
          ],
          "watchRules": {
            "metadata": {
              "filters": [
                "watchId:215276026059506"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no watches configured in the workspace, you'll see

```json
{
  "data": {
    "watches": {
      "items": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Deleting Watches

To delete a watch, use the following mutation example. Copy the long number from
`watchId` in `$.data.watches.items[].watchRules.metadata.filters[].watchId` from
the results of the `MyWatches` query.

```graphql
mutation DeleteMyWatch {
  deleteWatch(input: { id: "215276026059506" }) {
    handler
    filters
  }
}
```

Upon successful deletion, you will see a similar response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "deleteWatch": {
      "handler": {
        "action": "tmod:@turbot/firehose-aws-sns#/action/types/router"
      },
      "filters": [
        "resourceId:185423120545381 level:self,descendant notificationType:active_grants_deleted"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Running `MyWatches` again should show that the watch has been deleted.

## Notifications

A Notification represents an event that occurred in Guardrails. The notification
will include detailed information about the affected resource, control, policy
value, policy setting, etc. This data includes the object detail before and
after the event, standard Guardrails metadata, and other details of the event.

### Sample Notification

Below is a sample notification of type `active_grants_deleted`.

```json
{
  "notificationType": "active_grants_deleted",
  "actor": {
    "identity": {
      "picture": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb9ff8606c24daf9cda1d82615bd7a8e",
      "turbot": {
        "title": "Timon Berkowitz",
        "id": "186957187212252"
      },
      "title": "Timon Berkowitz"
    }
  },
  "turbot": {
    "id": "202473982728085",
    "createTimestamp": "2020-09-10T17:34:58.063Z"
  },
  "oldActiveGrant": {
    "grant": {
      "type": {
        "trunk": {
          "title": "Turbot"
        }
      },
      "level": {
        "trunk": {
          "title": "User > Metadata > ReadOnly"
        }
      },
      "resource": {
        "trunk": {
          "title": "Turbot"
        }
      },
      "identity": {
        "trunk": {
          "title": "Turbot > Turbot Local > Pumbaa Smith"
        }
      }
    },
    "resource": {
      "trunk": {
        "title": "Turbot"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Notification Template

The "Render Template" pipeline action will execute the query and nunjucks
template in the Notification Template policy. The transformed notification will
then be placed on the Firehose SNS topic. These render templates are implemented
as Guardrails policies. You may choose to override these templates (policies) in the
format that is suitable for your need. For example, in order to update the
render template for `active_grants_deleted` notification type, use the Guardrails
Policy
`Turbot > Firehose > AWS SNS > Notification Template > Active Grants Deleted`.
All supported templates can be found under the parent policy type
`Turbot > Firehose > AWS SNS > Notification Template > *`.

Additional information can be added to the notification queries in the
Notification templates. Use the GraphiQL Developers tab in the Guardrails console to
test out altered notification queries.

The output of the notification template by default is JSON but can be in
whatever format fits your needs best.

Notification templates cannot be made into calculated policies.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes a part of the Firehose data path breaks down. The questions below
point to common points of missing or misconfiguration of the Firehose pipeline.

For reference, here's the data path again. Each one of these steps needs to
operational for notifications to flow.

```
Notification generated (resource, control, policy, etc) -> Watch -> Render the Notification Template -> Publish to AWS SNS topic -> Downstream integrations
```

### Firehose Mod and Policies

- Is the Guardrails Firehose mod installed and has no errors?
- Are all the firehose policies set up to known good values? Topic ARN, Access
  Key, Access Secret.
- If the Firehose was configured manually, have you configured all the same
  resources as created by the Firehose Terraform in the
  [Guardrails Samples Repo](https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-tools/tree/master/mod_examples/firehose-aws-sns/setup/terraform)?

### Firehose Watches

- If notifications aren't coming through, set the watch to something as broad as
  possible and attached to the Guardrails resource; something like "get
  control_updated notifications for all {platform} controls for all {platform}
  resources in the workspace". This has the best chance to generate some traffic
  on the firehose topic. Such a broad scope for notification may be long-term
  undesirable but is very helpful for validating the Firehose data path. Watches
  can always be refined later.
- Does your watch filter have any typos in it? Developing a filter string using
  [Creating Filters For Watches](#creating-filters-for-watches) helps eliminate
  subtle typos and gives a preview of notifications the Firehose will deliver.
- Are the watches attached to the right resource? Make sure the watch is
  attached to either the Guardrails resource ('tmod:@turbot/turbot#/'), a folder or
  a cloud account.
- Does the watch filtering for the right kinds of notification?
- It's easy to generate `controls_updated` traffic by switching a policy
  exception on a single resource from `Check: Enabled` to `Check: Disabled` and
  back again. Changing the resource works in the platform console works too.

### Firehose Notification Templates

- Start with the default notification templates. Add conservatively from there.
- The notification query can be tested in the GraphiQL Developer's console in
  the top right corner of the Guardrails console. This is a great place to
  experiment with adding or removing parts from the notification query.

### Firehose Topic and User

- Can you send messages to the Firehose topic using the AWS cli and the Firehose
  user credentials?
- As a troubleshooting measure only, enable success and failure delivery logging
  for the Firehose SNS topic. This can tell you if there are any problems with
  the SNS subscription. In high volume environments, keeping success delivery
  logging after initial configuration may be unnecessary.
- What are the firehose topic subscriptions? Sending to an SQS queue or to an
  email address are common subscription endpoints.
- For enterprise customers, do you see log entries in the
  `/aws/lambda/{turbot_prefix}_turbotfirehoseawssnssender-{hash}` CloudWatch
  Logs? SaaS customers please work with Guardrails Customer Success to investigate
  Firehose problems.
- Does the Firehose Topic policy allow the Firehose IAM user to publish to it?
  (No permissions beyond publish are required.)
- Do you have a plan for Access Key rotation?

### Downstream Integrations

- There is some lag from when a notification is generated till it shows up on
  the firehose topic. A lag of 30 to 60 seconds is common; 5 minutes has been
  observed too. Delivery depends on overall system load.
- If there is additional routing that happens after the firehose SNS, does it
  work when messages are fed manually onto the Firehose topic?
