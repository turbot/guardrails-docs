# Governing GitHub

Turbot Guardrails provides comprehensive governance for [GitHub](https://github.com/), enabling secure, compliant, and efficient management of your GitHub resources.

Guardrails ensures effective management and real-time visibility into your GitHub organizations with the following capabilities:
- **Policy Management**: Offers a variety of GitHub mods with policies and controls to manage repositories, teams, and organizations.
- **Real-Time Event Handling**: Updates the Guardrails CMDB as repositories, teams, and permissions are created, modified, or deleted, enabling immediate policy enforcement.
- **Activity Visibility**: Provides insights into all activity within GitHub organizations, including who made changes, what was changed, and when it occurred.
