The Guardrails Enterprise installation is highly customizable, allowing you to deploy Guardrails in the way that most appropriately balances your availability, performance, security, and cost requirements.
- Guardrails can be installed in up to 3 availability zones per region.
- Guardrails was designed as a multi-tenant application, providing logical and physical separation of workspaces.
- Guardrails leverages AWS native services, containers, and serverless compute to minimize costs and administrative overhead.
