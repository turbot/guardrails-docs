# Creating a Folder

In this guide, you will:

- Create a folder.
- Add a description to the folder.
- Troubleshoot common issues.

[Folders](/guardrails/docs/concepts/resources/hierarchy#folders) provide a high level arrangement of resources in Guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Owner** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with Guardrails console.


## Creating a Folder

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via SAML-based login.

At the top section of the home page, click the **Resources** card and navigate to the resource that will be the `parent` of the new folder. In this example, a new folder is going to be created at the `Turbot` level. You can choose any existing folder to create sub-folders under it.

On the far right, select **New** and then select **Folder** in the **Resource Type** drop down menu.

![Create Folder](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/configuring-guardrails/working-with-folders/create-folder-1.png)


Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the folder. Select **Create**.

## Review

- [ ] Validate that the folder has been created by navigating to the resource path and selecting the **Resources** tab.

That's it! The folder is created immediately and will be viewable in the UI.
