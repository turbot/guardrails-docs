# Deleting a folder

In this guide, you will:

- Delete a folder.
- Troubleshoot common issues.

[Folders](/guardrails/docs/concepts/resources/hierarchy#folders) provide a high level arrangement of resources in Guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Owner** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with Guardrails console.

## Step 1: Find Folder

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via SAML-based login.

Select the **Resources** tab, navigate to the parent folder in this case it's `Turbot`, select the folder you wish to delete.

## Step 2: Delete Folder

Select the desired folder to delete. Select **Remove from Turbot** from **Actions** dropdown.

Be sure to read the dialogue box that pops up! Type the folder's full name to
confirm the deletion, then click **Delete**.

## Step: 3 Review

- [ ] Validate that the folder has been deleted by navigating to the resource path and confirming it no longer appears in the **Resources** folder section.

That's it! The folder is deleted immediately and will no longer be viewable in the UI.
