# Deleting a Folder

In this guide, you will:

- Delete a folder.
- Troubleshoot common issues.

[Folders](/guardrails/docs/concepts/resources/hierarchy#folders) provide a structured way to organize resources in Guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Owner** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the Guardrails console.

## Step 1: Find the Folder

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via SAML-based login.

Navigate to the **Resources** tab, locate the **folders** section, and select the folder you wish to rename.

## Step 2: Delete the Folder

Select the folder you want to delete. Select **Actions**, then choose **Remove from Turbot**.

A confirmation dialog will appear. *Read the prompt carefully*. Type the folder's **full name** to confirm the deletion, then click **Delete**.

## Step 3: Review

- [ ] Validate that the folder has been successfully deleted by navigating to the resource path and confirming that it no longer appears in the **Resources** section.

That's it! The folder is deleted immediately and will no longer be viewable in the UI.
