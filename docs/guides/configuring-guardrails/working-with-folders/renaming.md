# Renaming a Folder

In this guide, you will:

- Rename a folder.
- Update a description to the folder if applicable.
- Troubleshoot common issues.

[Folders](/guardrails/docs/concepts/resources/hierarchy#folders) provide a high level arrangement of resources in Guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Owner** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with Guardrails console.

## Step 1: Find Folder

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via SAML-based login.

Select the **Resources** tab, navigate to the parent folder in this case it's `Turbot`, select the folder you wish to delete.

That's it! The folder is renamed immediately.
