# Renaming a Folder

In this guide, you will:

- Rename a folder.
- Update the folder description if applicable.
- Troubleshoot common issues.

[Folders](/guardrails/docs/concepts/resources/hierarchy#folders) provide a structured way to organize resources in Guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Owner** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the Guardrails console.

## Step 1: Find the Folder

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via SAML-based login.

Navigate to the **Resources** tab, locate the **folders** section, and select the folder you wish to rename.
