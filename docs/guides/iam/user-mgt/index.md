# Adding users to the local directory

The Guardrails installation process will create a local directory with a single admin user.  After installation, you may add additional users to this directory, or add additional directories that can authenticate to Guardrails.

You may add users to the default Guardrails directory if you do not wish to use a federated login, for break-glass access, or other reasons.

#### To add a local user:

1. Log into the Guardrails application, click the **Permissions** tab. Click the **DIRECTORIES** card.

5. Click the key icon next to the user to set a password. Save the password in a secure location. This is the password that the user will use to login to Guardrails.
