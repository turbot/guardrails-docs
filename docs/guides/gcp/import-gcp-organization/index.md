# Import a GCP Organization

In this guide, you will:

- Learn how to import an entire Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Organization into Turbot Guardrails. This process allows Guardrails to discover and manage resources across all projects and folders under a single GCP Organization.
- Monitor and troubleshoot the process.

Importing a [GCP Organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#organizations) into Guardrails involves these key steps:

- Configuring a [GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) with appropriate permissions at the Organization level.
- Importing the Organization via the Guardrails Console.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with GCP Console with admin privileges.
- Access to the Guardrails console with *Turbot/Owner* or *Turbot/Admin* permissions at the Turbot resource level.

## Supported Authentication

Guardrails provides support for *two credential methods* to import a GCP Organization. The supported methods are:

- **Service Account Impersonation**: Grants temporary credentials using the [Service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts).
- **JSON File**: Uses a downloaded JSON key file to authenticate or you can provide *Private key as text* which requires copying and pasting the `private_key` section of the JSON file.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend `Service Account Impersonation`, as it eliminates the need to download or manage a JSON key, reducing security risks.

## Service Account

For an Organization import in Guardrails, you will:
Create the service account in any single project under your organization. Refer [Prepare a GCP project for import to Guardrails](/guardrails/docs/getting-started/getting-started-gcp/prepare-project)

## Granting Role(s)

> [!NOTE]
> In GCP, service accounts belong to a specific project, even if their permissions apply at the project, folder, or organization level.

To assign the required roles at the `Organization` scope to the service account, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **IAM** in the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Select your **Organization** from the resource selector.
3. Select **Grant Access**.
4. Enter the **Principal** as `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
5. Assign the required roles at the organization (or folder) scope as described in [What Permissions to Grant](#what-permissions-to-grant).

Refer to the example below for guidance:

![Service Account with Organization Scope](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/gcp/import-gcp-organization/service-account-with-org-scope.png)

<details>
  <summary>CLI Reference: Create a Service Account and Assign Organization-Level Roles</summary>

```bash
# 1. Create the service account in a specific project
gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME --project=PROJECT_ID --description="Service account for Guardrails"

# 2. Assign roles at the organization level
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ORGANIZATION_ID --member="serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="ROLE_NAME"
```
</details>

## What Permissions to Grant

The permissions you grant to the service account depend on your organizationâ€™s security and compliance requirements. The table below outlines the minimum recommendations for organization-wide governance:

| **Permission Level** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        | **Recommended Role**                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Remediation**  | Provides Guardrails with the broadest level of control across your GCP Organization, allowing full governance and policy enforcement.                                | [Organization Administrator](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-org#resourcemanager.organizationAdmin) (`roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`) or equivalent custom roles. |
| **Read-Only**         | Allows Guardrails to perform discovery and track resources but does not enable any remediation actions.                                                            | Viewer roles at the organization level (e.g., `roles/viewer`).                                                        |
| **Folder Viewer**   | Grants read-only access to view metadata and browse resources within a specific GCP folder, without modifying them.                                                                                            | `roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer`.                                                                                 |
| **Organization Viewer**| Allows read-only access to view metadata and monitor all resources at the organization level, enabling oversight without configuration changes.                                                  | [Organization Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-org#resourcemanager.organizationViewer) `roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer`.                                                                           |
| **Project Viewer**      | Provides read-only access to view project-level metadata and resources, ensuring visibility without allowing any modifications.                                                                                     | `roles/viewer`.                                                                                                       |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For importing the organization, you need only `Organization Viewer`, `Project Viewer`, and `Folder Viewer` roles, which will allow discovery of all resources under the organization.

> If Guardrails attempts an action (e.g., enabling APIs, modifying resources) without sufficient permissions, you will encounter `access denied` errors. To resolve this, ensure the required permissions are granted or update the Guardrails policies to align with your organization's requirements.

## Enable Required APIs

Guardrails requires access to the `Cloud Resource Manager` and `Service Management` APIs (at a minimum) to discover and manage organization-wide resources. To enable these APIs, follow the steps below:

- In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), navigate to **APIs & Services** for the same GCP project where the service account was created.
- Locate the **Cloud Resource Manager API** and **Service Management API**.
- Select **ENABLE** for each API.

Refer to the example below for guidance:

![Enable API](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/gcp/import-gcp-organization/enable-api.png)

<details>
  <summary>CLI Reference: Enable Required APIs</summary>

```bash
# Enable Cloud Resource Manager for the project where the service account lives
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com --project=PROJECT_ID

# Enable Service Management for the same project
gcloud services enable servicemanagement.googleapis.com --project=PROJECT_ID
```
</details>

## Using Service Account Impersonation

[Service Account Impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts) grants short-lived credentials to Guardrails, allowing it to act as a specified service account without requiring a JSON key file. This approach reduces the security risk of storing or distributing long-lived credentials.

### Prerequisites for Configuration

- The **impersonating** user or service account i.e. `the identity that runs Guardrails `must have the **Service Account Token Creator** role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`) on the target service account.

- The **target** service account just created for organization importing purpose i.e. the one being impersonated must have the **required organization-level permissions** as as described in [What Permissions to Grant](#what-permissions-to-grant) to discover or manage resources across your GCP Organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Below CLI command is generated in Guardrails console when you choose `Access Mode` as Service Account Impersonation, provide `Organization ID` and `Client email`.

Refer to the example below for guidance:

![Generate Service Account Impersonation](/images/docs/guardrails/guides/gcp/import-gcp-organization/generate-service-account-impersonation.png)


<details>
  <summary>Example: Assign Service Account Token Creator</summary>

```bash
# Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME and PROJECT_ID with your service account's name/project
# Replace IMPERSONATOR_EMAIL with the user or service account that will impersonate it

gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --member="user:IMPERSONATOR_EMAIL" --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```
</details>

## Using JSON Credential File

- In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
- Select the **Project** where your service account resides.
- Locate the service account you created for Guardrails, and select on its **Actions** menu (three dots on the right).
- Select [Manage keys](/guardrails/docs/getting-started/getting-started-gcp/prepare-project#step-7-locate-key-manager).
- Select [Add key and Create new key](/guardrails/docs/getting-started/getting-started-gcp/prepare-project#step-8-add-key)
- Choose **JSON** as the **Key type**, and click **Create**.
- A JSON file will download automatically to your local machine. **Keep this file secure**. E.g. Save this as `key.json`.

<details>
  <summary>Example: Using CLI Command</summary>

```bash
# This command will create a file named "key.json" in your current directory
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account=guardrails-sa@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

</details>

## Using Private Key

The `private_key` in the `key.json` you generated is the **required secret** to import the GCP organization into a Guardrails workspace. Guardrails requires this key in **multi-line** format, **not** as a single, long string.

For example, after generating your JSON key file (`key.json`), you can extract the private key portion by running:

```bash
cat key.json | jq -r .private_key
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQClvph2e9f6Dl/H
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
<truncated>
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Pwd0PmmSB1U3h3+Ued/eDhw=
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```
> [!NOTE]
> You may use one of the option either [Using Using JSON Credential File](#using-json-credential-file) or [Using Private Key](#using-private-key) or [Using Service Account Impersonation](#using-service-account-impersonation)

## Import Organization in Guardrails Console
(BELOW SECTION PENDING)
- **Log in** to your Guardrails workspace console with **Turbot/Owner** or **Turbot/Admin** permissions.
- Select the **Import** card, then select **GCP Organization**.
- On the import screen, **choose one of the three methods**:
  - **Service Account Impersonation**
    - Provide the **Service Account** email in the form `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
  - **JSON File**
    - Click **Upload JSON** and select your JSON file.
  - **Private Key**
    - Paste the entire contents of your JSON key (multi-line, including the `BEGIN` and `END` lines).
- Provide the **Organization ID** for your GCP Organization.
- Choose the **Parent Resource** in Guardrails (e.g., a folder or workspace) under which this GCP Organization should be placed.
- Click **Import** to begin the discovery and management process. Guardrails will create and run discovery controls for your GCP Organization, scanning each project and resource based on your configured policies.

> **Note**: If you see `access denied` or other errors, verify that you have assigned the appropriate roles:
>
> - `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` for **Service Account Impersonation**.
> - Correct **JSON key** and **client_email** for **JSON File** / **Private Key**.
> - Proper **organization-level** roles (e.g., `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`) on the service account for full remediation.

## Ensure Billing is Enabled

If you plan to allow Guardrails to enable new APIs or create resources that may incur charges, ensure that billing is enabled at the **organization** level or for specific projects as required.

1. Navigate to the **API Console** in the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. From the project list, select the desired project.
3. Open the left-side menu and select **Billing**.
4. If billing is not enabled, click **Enable Billing**. *(Note: If billing is already enabled, this option will not appear.)*
5. If you donâ€™t have a billing account, create one:
   - Select your location.
   - Complete the billing account setup form.
   - Click **Submit** and **Enable Billing**.

## Troubleshooting

### Access Denied

Common causes of `access denied`:

- **Missing Token Creator Role** (for Impersonation): If using Service Account Impersonation, the impersonating user or workload must have `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the service account.

- **Malformed Secret Key**: Guardrails requires the multi-line format of the Secret Key. The beginning `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and ending `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` are necessary.

- **Improper Client Email**: Guardrails cannot use a non-service account email to get access to the project. The Client Email must be in the form of `{identifier}@{your-project-id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

- **Missing or Insufficient Permissions**: If Guardrails has been asked to discover,
  track or remediate resources that it does not have permissions for, then
  `access denied` errors will pop up for the GCP Discovery and CMDB controls in the Guardrails console. These should be
  resolved as quickly as possible.

### Lots of Controls in Error state

If there were some initial problems with credentials after project import, there may be a large number of Discovery controls in `error`. These can be resolved in one of two ways. First, simply delete the project and reimport it with proper
credentials. Second, keep the project imported but rerun each control in `error` using the run_controls scripts in the Guardrails Samples Repo available in [Python](https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples/tree/main/api_examples/python/run_controls), [Javascript](https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples/tree/main/api_examples/node/run-controls)
or [shell](https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples/tree/main/api_examples/shell/run-controls). The filter of `state:error` to rerun all controls in `error`.

### GCP Service API Enabled policies aren't set

- If the `GCP > {Service} > API Enabled` policy has not been set to `Enforce: Enabled` then the Discovery and CMDB controls will go to `skipped` for that Service's resources. Enable the `API Enabled` policy to resolve.
- If Guardrails does not have write permissions to enable APIs, then the applicable service API must be enabled manually.
