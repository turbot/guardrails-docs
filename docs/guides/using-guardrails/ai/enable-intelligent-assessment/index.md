# Enabling Intelligent Assessment Control

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Set up custom user prompts and context for resource evaluation
- Implement intelligent assessment for S3 bucket controls as an example

With the new [Intelligent Assessment](/guardrails/docs/concepts/guardrails/intelligent-assessment) guardrail [control](/guardrails/docs/reference/glossary#control), Turbot Guardrails now provides an AI-powered approach to defining guardrails using natural language prompts. This allows you to define governance policies by simply describing what you want to check, opening up new possibilities for governance scenarios that benefit from freeform, custom logic.

## Prerequisites

- *Turbot/Admin* permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the [Guardrails console](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/getting-started/).
- Ensure the [Turbot > AI > Configuration](/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/ai/ai-configuration) is established.

## Step 1: Enable Intelligent Assessment Control

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via a SAML-based login.

Enable the following policy at the Turbot level: **Turbot > AI > Control > Intelligent Assessment > Enabled**. This enables AI capabilities for Intelligent Assessment controls.

> [!NOTE]
> - The default value is `Disabled`. You can enable it based on your requirements.
> - In case enabled at the Turbot level in [Turbot AI Configuration > Step 7](/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/ai/ai-configuration#step-7-enable-configuration), Intelligent Assessment control becomes available for use.

For this guide, the `Turbot > AI > Control > Intelligent Assessment > Enabled` policy is set to `Enabled`.

## Step 2: Add User Prompt

First, locate the policy in the policy tree by navigating to **Policies** tab, search `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Intelligent Assessment > User Prompt` policy and select **New Policy Setting**.

![Locate User Prompt Policy](./locate-user-prompt-policy.png)

Here you can define the prompt that will be sent to the AI provider for assessing the required cloud provider resources. The prompt should clearly outline what the AI should evaluate.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set this policy at the resource, account, or folder level.
> For more information, see [Guardrails Policy Hierarchy](/guardrails/docs/concepts/policies/hierarchy).

**Example Prompt:**
```
- Confirm that logging is enabled and logs are sent to a secure location.
- Check if versioning is enabled and multi-factor delete is configured when the bucket has a tag "Environment":"Non-Compliant Tag". If it doesn't have the tag, only check if versioning is enabled.
```

## Step 3: Set Primary Policy to Check Mode

As the user prompt is set now, let's try to set up one S3 bucket policy to use the user prompt.

To access the control:

1. Navigate to `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Intelligent Assessment` from **Controls** tab
2. Select any bucket you would like to evaluate

In the **Policies** tab, if not set earlier, you may find `Intelligent Assessment` is set to `Skip`

![Create Settings](./aws-s3-bucket-create-setting.png)

Select **CREATE SETTING** and choose `Check: User prompt`. This policy activates intelligent assessments for the S3 bucket based on your user prompt and context.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set this policy at the resource, account, or folder level.
> For more information, see [Guardrails Policy Hierarchy](/guardrails/docs/concepts/policies/hierarchy).

## Step 4: Check Control Status

The control will assess the S3 bucket using configured user prompt and evaluate the control.
