# Policy Pack Summary

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Enable and configure Policy Pack Summary feature
- View AI-generated summaries of policy pack configurations and purposes
- Understand how to use these summaries for better policy management and team collaboration


The `Policy Pack Summary` feature uses AI to analyze policy packs and provide clear, human-readable summaries of their purpose and configuration. Here's how it works:

- **Comprehensive Policy Analysis**: Get detailed insights into policy configurations, dependencies, and hierarchies across your policy packs. For example, see how AWS security baseline policies interconnect with compliance requirements.

- **Clear Purpose & Scope**: Understand the main objectives and coverage of each policy pack at a glance. The summary clearly outlines which services are governed (e.g., AWS S3, EC2, IAM) and what security aspects are monitored.

> [!TIP]
> Use the policy pack summary to:
> - Quickly onboard new team members
> - Validate policy pack configurations
> - Document your governance approach

## Prerequisites

- *Turbot/Admin* permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the [Guardrails console](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/getting-started/).
- Ensure the [Turbot > AI > Configuration](/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/ai/ai-configuration) is established.

## Step 1: Configure AI Setup

Before using Intelligent Assessment control, ensure you have configured the required AI settings.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [AI Configuration Guide](/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/ai/ai-configuration).

## Step 2: Enable Policy Pack Summary

In **Policies** tab, navigate to `Turbot > AI > Policy Pack` and select **Summary**.

> [!NOTE]
> - The default value is `Disabled`. You can enable it based on your requirements.
> - In case enabled at the Turbot level in [Turbot AI Configuration > Step 7](/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/ai/ai-configuration#step-7-enable-configuration), Intelligent Assessment control becomes available for use.

For this guide, the `Turbot > AI > Policy Pack > Summary > Enabled` policy is set to `Enabled`.

## Step 3: Check Policy Pack Summary

To check the policy pack summary, navigate to **Policy Packs** section of **Policies** tab. Select any Policy Pack to vew the summary.
