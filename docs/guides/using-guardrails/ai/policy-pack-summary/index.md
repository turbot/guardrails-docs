# Policy Pack Summary

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Get AI-generated remediation steps for non-compliant resources
- Review and implement recommended fixes for security and compliance issues
- Understand the context and impact of suggested remediation actions

The Intelligent Fixes feature provides AI-powered remediation recommendations for non-compliant cloud resources.

When a resource is found to be non-compliant, Intelligent Fixes analyzes:

- The current resource configuration
- The AI then generates detailed, contextual remediation steps that:
  - Explain what needs to be changed
  - Provide specific commands or actions to implement the fix in form of scripts for remediation in CLI, Terraforma and CloudFormation
  - Highlight potential risks or considerations

## Prerequisites

- *Turbot/Admin* permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the [Guardrails console](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/getting-started/).
- Ensure the [Turbot > AI > Configuration](/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/ai/ai-configuration) is established.

## Step 1: Configure AI Setup

Before using Intelligent Assessment control, ensure you have configured the required AI settings.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [AI Configuration Guide](/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/ai/ai-configuration).

## Step 2: Enable Policy Pack Summary

In **Policies** tab, navigate to `Turbot > AI > Policy Pack` and select **Summary**.
