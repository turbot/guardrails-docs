# Find Policies in TBD State

In this guide, you will:
- Use the Guardrails console to review and resolve policies in a TBD state.

An ideal workspace uses policies to meet business requirements through secure enforcement, exception management, and shared defaults. [Policies](/guardrails/docs/concepts/policies) in an `OK`, `Alarm`, or `Skipped` state indicate a healthy environment. However, policies in a `TBD` state must be addressed to maintain consistency and prevent errors.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Operator** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the Guardrails console.

## Step 1: Log In to the Guardrails Console

Log in to the Guardrails console.

## Step 2: Access Reports

Choose **Reports** from the top navigation menu.

## Step 3: Filter Policies by State

Under Policies, select **Policy Values by State**.

From the **State** filter dropdown, select **TBD**. This will list the policy values currently in a `TBD` state.

## Step 4: Review the Cause

Select a policy value in the `TBD` state and review the cause of the issue.

Resolve Errors and Optimize Controls

1. **Review Policies and Errors**: Identify the cause of policies in the TBD state and take necessary actions.
2. **Policy Misconfiguration**: Adjust the settings and apply changes as needed to resolve the issue. Ensure configurations align with workspace requirements.
3. **Product-Related Issues**: Document and report any product-related issues for further investigation.
