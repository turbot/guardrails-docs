# Exporting Policy Pack as CSV

In this guide, you will:
- Use the Guardrails console to export policy settings as a CSV file.

Exporting Turbot Guardrails policy settings as a CSV file enables collaboration and facilitates reviews.

Follow these steps to export policy packs in CSV format.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Operator** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the Guardrails console.
