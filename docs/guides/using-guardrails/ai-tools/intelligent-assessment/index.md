# S3 Intelligent Assessment Control

In this guide, you will:
- Set up and run the S3 Intelligent Assessment Control.

The Intelligent Assessment control performs an AI-powered assessment of S3 buckets using your configured AI provider, custom user prompt, and context.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Owner** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the Guardrails console.
- Access credentials for the AI model.

## Step 1: Log in to the Guardrails Console

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via a SAML-based login.

## Step 2: Navigate to Turbot AI Policy

From the Policies section, navigate to **Turbot > AI**

## Step 3: Configure AI

Go to **Turbot > AI > Configuration** and update the following policies:

- **Turbot > AI > Configuration > API Key [Default]**: Set the API key Guardrails will use to authenticate with the AI service provider.
- **Turbot > AI > Configuration > Provider [Default]**: Specify the AI provider for Guardrailsâ€™ AI-powered features and capabilities.
- **Turbot > AI > Configuration > Model [Default]**: Define which model to use with the selected AI provider for processing requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Supported and tested models include:  
> `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`, `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, and `gpt-4o`.  
> Using lower-tier models may lead to varied results.

## Step 4: Enable Intelligent Assessment

Enable the following policy at the Turbot level **Turbot > AI > Control > Intelligent Assessment > Enabled**. This enables AI capabilities for Intelligent Assessment controls.

## Step 5: Navigate to S3 Intelligent Assessment

Once AI Control is configured, navigate to  **AWS > S3 > Intelligent Assessment**

In the Policies section, set **AWS > S3 > Bucket > Intelligent Assessment**  `Check: User prompt`. This policy activates intelligent assessments for the S3 bucket based on your user prompt and context.

## Step 6: Add a User Prompt

Set your custom prompt under **AWS > S3 > Bucket > Intelligent Assessment > User Prompt**. This defines the prompt that will be sent to the AI provider for assessing the S3 bucket. The prompt should clearly outline what the AI should evaluate.

**Example**:  
`Confirm that logging is enabled and logs are sent to a secure location.`

The control will assess the S3 bucket using this prompt and return a response.

> [!NOTE]
> The output is generated by the AI provider and may vary based on the model's capabilities and input details.
