# Stacks

Guardrails [Stack controls](/guardrails/docs/concepts/guardrails/stacks) provides a mechanism for managing resource configuration using OpenTofu, an open-source implementation of Terraform.  Guardrails can apply your configuration at regular intervals, or whenever resources change, enforcing your standards and preventing configuration drift.
