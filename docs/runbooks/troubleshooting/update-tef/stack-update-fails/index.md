# Stack Update Fails

When working with the TEF (Turbot Enterprise Foundation) stack, you might encounter an issue where the stack update fails. This can prevent you from making necessary changes or updates and may cause the TEF provisioned product in Service Catalog to change to a `Tainted` status.

## Issue

The most common reason for this issue is lack of permissions. Attempting to make changes during this time will result in an error.

**Error Message**:

"S3 error: Access Denied For more information check http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html"
