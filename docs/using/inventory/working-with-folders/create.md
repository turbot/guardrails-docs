# Creating a Folder

In this guide, you will:

- Create a folder.
- Add a description to the folder.
- Troubleshoot common issues.

[Folders](/guardrails/docs/concepts/resources/hierarchy#folders) provide a structured way to organize resources in Guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- **Turbot/Owner** permissions at the Turbot resource level.
- Familiarity with the Guardrails console.

## Step 1: Create a Folder

Log in to the Guardrails console using your local credentials or via SAML-based login.

On the **Home** page, select the **Resources** card, then navigate to the resource that will act as the `parent` of the new folder. In this example, a new folder is created at the **Turbot** level, but you can also create sub-folders under an existing folder.

On the far right, select **New**, then choose **Folder** from the **Resource Type** dropdown menu.

![Create Folder](/images/docs/guardrails/using/inventory/working-with-folders/create-folder-1.png)

Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the folder. Click **Create**.

## Step 2: Review

- [ ] Validate that the folder has been created by navigating to the resource path and selecting the **Resources** tab.

That's it! The folder is created immediately and will be visible in the UI.
