# Turbot Guardrails Documentation Style Guide

This rule consolidates and summarizes the key requirements for writing any Turbot Guardrails guide, based on the [official style guide](mdc:https:/github.com/turbot/pipes-docs/blob/style_guide/STYLE.md#writing-turbot-guardrails-guides) and internal standards.

## General Rules
- All guides must include YAML frontmatter with `title`, `sidebar_label`, and `guide_type`.
- The main heading (`#`) must match the `title` and `sidebar_label` exactly.
- Use AP Title Case for all section headers.
- Use consistent capitalization in headers and titles.
- Use markdown image syntax for screenshots; store images in the same directory as the guide, or in `/images/docs/guardrails/` with descriptive alt text and matching subdirectory.
- Use blockquote call-outs (Note, Tip, Important, Warning, Caution) as appropriate.
