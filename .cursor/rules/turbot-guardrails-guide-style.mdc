# Turbot Guardrails Documentation Style Guide

This rule consolidates and summarizes the key requirements for writing any Turbot Guardrails guide, based on the [official style guide](mdc:https:/github.com/turbot/pipes-docs/blob/style_guide/STYLE.md#writing-turbot-guardrails-guides) and internal standards.

## Structure
- Start with YAML frontmatter: `title` and `sidebar_label` in Title Case, matching the main heading.
- The main heading (`#`) must match the `title` and `sidebar_label` exactly.
- The overview appears immediately after the title (no `## Overview` header). Briefly explain the guide's purpose.
- Use AP Title Case for all section headers.
- Section titles should be 5 words or less and start with a command (e.g., Launch, Create, Access).
- Use `select` for on-screen selections and `choose` for dropdowns/lists.
- Link glossary terms the first time they appear.
- Avoid parenthetical references in titles unless referring to specific tools.
- Use consistent capitalization in headers and titles.

## Required Sections
1. **Overview** (no header): What the user will do, what it is, and why it matters.
2. **Prerequisites**: List requirements with links.
3. **Steps**: Each step as its own `## Step X: Verb Noun` header (e.g., `## Step 1: Access AWS Console`). Steps should begin with a verb. Include a **Monitor** step and a final **Review** step. Steps must be clear, actionable, and numbered consistently.
4. **Next Steps**: Link to related guides or docs.
5. **Troubleshooting**: Use a table for common issues and solutions (optional but recommended).

## Formatting
- Use ordered lists for steps.
- Use markdown image syntax for screenshots; store images in the same directory as the guide, or in `/images/docs/guardrails/` with descriptive alt text and matching subdirectory.
- Use light mode PNG screenshots, 1280x640px, cropped to the active window.
- Use arrows and ovals for annotations as described in the style guide.
- Use blockquote call-outs (Note, Tip, Important, Warning, Caution) as appropriate.

## Sidebar Integration
- Reference guides in the sidebar using their directory path (e.g., `guides/aws/your-guide`), without the `/index` suffix.
- The navigation bar title should match the page title and file path.

For more details and examples, see the [official style guide](mdc:https:/github.com/turbot/pipes-docs/blob/style_guide/STYLE.md#writing-turbot-guardrails-guides).
